Traci Strohl, Treasurer/Intern Supervisor, PDP Committee - johnpl@cox.net
### Faculty Sponsor
Carlos Paniagua, Assistant Professor of Mathematical Sciences - carlos.paniagua@salve.edu

## Description
The Portsmouth Dog Park (PDP) committee is working an expansion project to allow for increased access to the current dog park. The PDP Committee has initiated a year-long data collection effort and analysis project underwritten by the van Beuren Charitable Foundation (VBCF) to determine a benchmark for monitoring park attendance. The results of this project will be incorporated into reporting to VBCF and used in support of PDP expansion efforts.

## Hours at the job site
The participants are expected to work on the activities 105 hours (about 8 hours per week for about 13 weeks) both at the job site and remotely from about January 24th to April 22nd, 2022.

## Contact hours with faculty
The participants and faculty sponsor will have 1 hour of contact (online/in person) distributed as necessary every two weeks to discuss progress of the internship activities.

</ol>

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of the internship activities, the participants will be able to
- Design a concrete observational research study.
- Conduct data collection using adequate sampling techniques to ensure data is representative of the target population.
-  Identify and solve potential issues with the data collection process.
-  Select appropriate technology for analysis and visualization of the data.
-  Compute relevant summary statistics.
-  Build appropriate data visualizations.
-  Communicate results of the study to stakeholders via written reports and visualizations.
-  Design and build a data product (dashboard) to communicate the study's results.

## Evaluation

Pass/Fail with 60% assessed by internship supervisor and 40% by faculty sponsor. Minimum  performance of 80% required for a passing grade.

## Other Policies (COVID)
This course has been designed to support students in their efforts to meet stated course outcomes. Course delivery may be altered by unexpected events or extenuating circumstances beyond the control of the professor; however, instruction will continue, and the learning goals will remain. If change in delivery or venue is required, faculty will provide protocols to students.

### Classroom Expectations
In compliance with the University’s continuing covid plan, students must comply with the most recent masking requirements. Students are not permitted to consume any food or beverage during in-person instruction. Students are required to sit in their assigned seats during class. Students should not reconfigure classroom furniture and will have the option to clean their seating areas upon arriving and departing the classroom; supplies will be provided in all classrooms. Faculty members will ask students to leave the classroom if they are unable to comply with these regulations.

### Policy for Isolated or Quarantined Students
If a student learns that they are required to isolate/quarantine (due to a positive covid test or a close contact), they must immediately email their instructors to notify them of the duration of the isolation/quarantine and to request appropriate academic support so that the student can continue in the course. Instructors will reply with an outline of the supports to be provided.

If a student experiences significant disruption to their learning due to multiple periods of required isolation/quarantine, they should work with the instructor and the dean of undergraduate studies to come to a resolution.

## Use of Salve Email

Please note that all official email communication at Salve Regina University involving faculty, students, and staff is to be conducted using Salve email (addresses ending in \@salve.edu). Students must regularly check their Salve email for important notifications from their faculty, the Registrar, and others.

## Academic Support

The Academic Center for Excellence (ACE) provides peer tutoring appointments that help students at all skill levels achieve academic success. Subject tutors review content and provide specific study strategies for courses in many disciplines. Writing tutors help any undergraduate student with every phase of the writing process from brainstorming to revision. Peer academic coaches help students reach academic goals by supporting students with time-management, note-taking, studying strategies and more. For more information or to schedule an appointment, visit https://salve.edu/academic-center-excellence (Links to an external site.) or call (401) 341-2226.

## Credit Hour

Salve Regina University awards academic credit hours for the successful completion of this course, and the course requires a significant commitment of time and effort from the student. Accreditation regulation requires that students complete (1) one hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out of class work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for one semester hour of credit, or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time; or (2) At least an equivalent amount of work for other learning activities such as laboratory work, internships, practica or studio work. The learning outcomes, assignments and workload for this course reflect this expectation.
